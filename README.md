### Hookup guide

	HX711 board pinout:
	- E+			GND -
	- E-			DT  -
	- A-			SCK -
	- A+			VCC -
	- B-
	- B+

	VCC - 2.7 ~ 5.5V
	On-chip analog supply regulator is not used ? (VSUP connected to DVDD)
	XI=GND   => Internal oscillator used.
	RATE=GND => Output data rate control, 0: 10Hz	
	
	J1 header					Load cell
	---------------------------------------------------
	E+ is VCC (excitation +)	
	E- is GND (excitation -)	
	A- is Output signal -
	A+ is Output signal +
	
	Load cell
	---------------------------------------------------
	WHITE <-> RED    ~ 1K, constant
	RED   <-> BLACK  ~ 1K, changes with applied force
	WHITE <-> BLACK  ~ 2K, sum of previous two pairs
	RED is center tap.
	
	
## Software aspects

### HX711 - pin aspects
	
	When output data is not ready for retrieval, digital output pin DOUT is high. Serial clock
	input PD_SCK should be low. When DOUT goes to low, it indicates data is ready for retrieval. By
	applying 25~27 positive clock pulses at the PD_SCK pin, data is shifted out from the DOUT
	output pin. Each PD_SCK pulse shifts out one bit, starting with the MSB bit first, until all 24 bits are
	shifted out. The 25th pulse at PD_SCK input will pull DOUT pin back to high
	
	Input and gain selection is controlled by the number of the input PD_SCK pulses:
	PD_SCK Pulses |	Input channel |	Gain
	------------------------------------
	25 			  |	A 			  |	128
	26 			  |	B 			  |	 32
	27 			  |	A 			  |	 64

	When PD_SCK Input is low, chip is in normal working mode.
	When PD_SCK pin changes from low to high and stays at high for longer than 60Î¼s, HX711 enters power down mode
	After a reset or power-down event, input selection is default to Channel A with a gain of 128.

			ADSK=0;
			if(ADDO) Count++;

		ADSK=1;
		Count=Count^0x800000;
		ADSK=0;
		return(Count);
	}
